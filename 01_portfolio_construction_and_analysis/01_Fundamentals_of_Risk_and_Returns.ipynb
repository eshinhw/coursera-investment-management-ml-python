    "It is important to note that they are a far from perfect measure. For instance, they are entirely defined by two points and hence are very **sensitive to outliers**. Second, they depend on the frequency of observations in general. A very deep drawdown on a daily or weekly basis might almost completely disappear or move to very different location based on monthly data. In other words, the drawdown on daily basis is very different from the drawdown on weekly basis. Thus, drawdowns are sensitive to time horizon. In spite of these shortcomings, drawdowns are closely monitored and popular amongst practitioners even though other measures like **VaR** and **CVaR** are more robust measures of extreme risk."
